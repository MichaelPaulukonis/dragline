# Implementation task checklist and notes suggestion (2025-09-30 19:42Z)

_**User (2025-09-30 19:45Z)**_

Stage Gate Prompt: Implementation Kick-off

Context: A feature folder (`save-delection`), including planning documents, has been moved into 
the implementation stage and the folder is referenced in this chat

Instructions:

1.  Analyze Plan: Read and understand the contents of the feature folder,
    focusing on `README.md`, `spec.md`, and `design.md`.
2.  Generate Task List: Based on the spec and design, generate a high-level 
    checklist of the main implementation tasks required to build this feature. 
    Phrase tasks clearly (e.g., "Set up database schema changes", 
    "Build API endpoint for X", "Create frontend component Y", "Write unit tests for Z").
    Save that task list into the attached folder as task_list.md
3.  Suggest Tracking: Recommend creating an `implementation_notes.md` 
    file within the feature folder to track detailed progress, technical 
    decisions, challenges encountered.
4.  Output: Provide the generated task checklist and the suggestion for creating `implementation_notes.md`.

Note
Once you have created the plan, then go ahead and implement this, I expect this
to be a long chain of requests and that you will use a number of tool calls to
achieve this.

**Outlining plan and approach****Opening spec.md****Opening design.md****Listing high-level tasks****Preparing final detailed response**

I’m putting together a clear final message that starts with a quick acknowledgement and outlines the approach taken, followed by a plan recap, a task checklist, the content of the created doc file, a suggestion to track the file, and a note on quality gates clarifying no tests ran since it’s documentation only. This structure will help the user see everything done and what’s next in a friendly, organized way.Reviewed the save-selection docs; laying out the implementation roadmap next.

## approach
- Digest the feature README, spec, and design notes to capture requirements.
- Translate those requirements into an actionable implementation checklist.
- Persist the checklist in `task_list.md` and call out the need for on-going implementation notes.

## task checklist
Saved to `task_list.md`:

- Establish in-memory selection state within `dragline.js`, including mode flag, bounds, aspect ratio, and last-used values.
- Wire modifier + save shortcut to toggle selection mode, initialize default/previous bounds, and exit cleanly on confirm or cancel keys.
- Implement pointer hit-testing that distinguishes dragging vs. corner/edge resizing, and snap updated bounds to grid cell increments.
- Build a dedicated overlay renderer (e.g., `renderSelectionOverlay`) that draws the dimmed mask, selection rectangle, and interactive handles without impacting frame rate.
- Gate existing block manipulation interactions while selection mode is active to prevent gesture conflicts.
- Extend `grid.js` (or adjacent utilities) with helpers to convert between pixel coordinates and grid-aligned bounds for snapping and display.
- Refactor the save pipeline to accept optional crop bounds, render the requested region at full resolution, and fall back to full-canvas exports when no bounds are supplied.
- Persist the last-used selection bounds for the current session so reopening the mode restores the previous crop.
- Add Jest unit tests covering the new grid snapping helpers and crop-bound calculations.
- Update user-facing documentation (`README`, shortcuts reference) to describe the selection workflow and any new commands.

## recommendation
Create an `implementation_notes.md` file in the same folder to log daily progress, design decisions, and blockers as you work through the checklist.

## quality gates
- Build/tests: not run (documentation-only change).

**Requirements coverage:** checklist ✅, implementation notes suggestion ✅.

**Planning incremental implementation****Continuing to verify save functionality****Planning selection feature additions****Adding pixel-to-grid helpers****Outlining selection feature implementation**

I’m mapping out a multi-step plan to add selection state, overlay rendering, input handling, grid helper functions, and save pipeline updates, aiming for modular, testable code. This includes creating a `selection.js` module to manage selection bounds and interaction, refining `dragline.js` to handle selection mode, and extending grid utilities for pixel-grid conversions with tests. The plan involves detailed strategies for maintaining aspect ratio during resizing, hit-testing handles, and integrating a cropped export feature when saving with selection active. It’s quite a hefty change, so I want to ensure clarity and incremental progress through new modules and helper functions.**Defining detailed selection module and integration plan**

I’m outlining exact helper functions and their logic for selection state management, pointer interaction handling, overlay rendering, and grid conversions. This includes precise hit-testing for handles, resizing with aspect ratio preservation, and rendering a dimmed overlay with selectable handles. I’m also planning updates to `dragline.js` for integrating selection mode toggling, pointer event gating, and modified save behavior supporting cropped exports. New `grid.js` helpers and tests will ensure pixel-grid conversions and bounds clamping work reliably. The approach aims for modular, incremental development with comprehensive coverage of UI and export features.**Planning canvas cropping and char grid updates**

I’m working through how to save a cropped selection image by rendering the current char grid in black-and-white on the main canvas, then capturing the relevant pixel area using `p.get()` and saving that image. To maintain clean separation, I’ll refactor char grid update and rendering logic so saving can ensure the grid is up to date and drawn without gradients or highlights. This means splitting char grid creation from rendering, updating `dragline.js` accordingly, and carefully restoring state after saving. I’ll proceed step-by-step to keep modifications manageable and consistent.
```

```
**Preparing new test file****Designing selection module and resize logic**

I'm outlining the `selection.js` module with core exported functions and a selection state object. I'll implement selection activation, pointer event handling, and complex resize calculations that preserve aspect ratio and stay within grid bounds. This involves carefully coding helpers like `resizeFromCorner` and `resizeFromEdge` to clamp sizes and positions correctly while handling pointer crossing and maintaining consistent interactions.**Revising resizeFromCorner logic**
```

```
**Adjusting dimension box sizing and positioning**
```

```
**Preserving text size state**
```

```
**Planning selection integration and grid updates**

I'm mapping out how to integrate selection state and handlers into the existing char grid rendering logic, reorganizing functions for refreshing and rendering the char grid, handling selection-based input gating, and ensuring constants and imports are well structured for reuse. I'm also designing new helper functions like `nudgeSelection` for keyboard-based adjustments while keeping the existing rendering flow smooth and robust.
```

```
**Refactoring imports in dragline.js**
```

```
**Preparing constants and selection state setup**
```

```
**Removing redundant constant declaration**
```

```
**Ensuring proper selection state and overlay rendering**

I'm checking whether `selectionState` needs reinitializing after `grid` dimensions update, but since the grid object is mutated and referenced directly, it might be OK as is. Next, I'm updating the `display` function to draw the selection overlay after the text areas and making sure it respects the gradient's visibility state so the overlay doesn't show when it shouldn't.
```

```
**Adjusting drawGradient for null gradients**
```

```
**Refactoring drawTextAreas with refresh helper**
```

```
**Integrating selection logic into mouse events**

I'm updating mousePressed, mouseDragged, and mouseReleased to handle selection state by intercepting input events when selection is active, preventing block interactions and ensuring the display refreshes appropriately. I'll also adjust dragging behavior to be skipped during active selection.
```

```
**Restructuring keyPressed for selection mode****Continuing to review code for keyPressed changes****Refactoring keyPressed and saveComposition logic**

I'm revising the keyPressed handler to cleanly separate selection mode controls from other shortcuts, ensuring ESC cancels selection but still toggles info box when no selection is active. I'll implement saveComposition to refresh the character grid, draw the canvas or selection with a white background, and save the image with distinct filenames for full or cropped captures while preserving previous state and restoring the display appropriately.
```

```
**Verifying canvas save and selection logic**

I'm checking all pieces involved in saving the canvas image—making sure key constants like `p.ALT` exist, `gridBoundsToPixels` returns integers, and cropping dimensions stay valid. I'm confirming overlays are disabled during save and that the selection state properly halts auto movement in the draw loop by adding a guard when active. This helps ensure saving works cleanly and selection interactions don't interfere unexpectedly.
```

```
**Reviewing selection mode and related updates****Preparing documentation updates****Updating usage table and docs for selection mode**
```

```
**Updating feature list**
```

```
**Updating FAQ answer about composition capture**
```

```
**Considering documentation updates**
```

```
**Preparing final verification steps****Summarizing completed selection feature work**

I’m reviewing all the relevant code changes and behavior around the new selection mode, including how saving works with gradients and character grid redraws, modifier key assumptions for shortcuts, and ensuring the final response clearly states what was changed, tested, and any follow-up notes like creating implementation documentation. I’ll organize the summary into clear sections covering actions taken, tests run, assumptions made, and requirements coverage as requested.Selection mode is live; here’s a concise rundown of what shipped and how to exercise it.

## actions taken
- Extended `grid.js` with pixel/grid conversion, bounds clamping, and region rendering helpers; added Jest coverage in `gridUtils.test.js`.
- Introduced `selection.js` to manage selection state, hit-testing, resizing (corners + edges), keyboard nudging, and overlay rendering with handles and dimension labels.
- Reworked `dragline.js` to integrate the selection workflow: Option/Alt + Shift + `S` enters selection mode, pointer/keyboard gestures manipulate the snapped bounds, Shift + `S`/Enter export the crop, and Shift + `S` outside the mode preserves the legacy full-canvas save. Also gated block interactions while the overlay is active and reused the fresh save pipeline.
- Updated `README.md` to document the new shortcuts, feature highlight, FAQ guidance, and project structure entry.

## tests
- `npm test` ✅ (covers existing suite plus new grid helper specs)

## notes
- Assumed the “modifier + save shortcut” means adding Option/Alt to the existing Shift + `S` combo for entering selection mode; adjust if another modifier is preferred.
- Still recommend creating `docs/2_inprogress/save-selection/implementation_notes.md` to log day-to-day decisions and gotchas as implementation continues.

## requirements coverage
- Selection state, shortcut wiring, pointer resize/drag, overlay rendering, interaction gating, grid snapping helpers, save pipeline refactor, session persistence, new tests, and documentation update — **Done**.

I changed the key for selectionToggle to be shift + A, because shift + ALT/opt was not working - I could register one modifer + 's' but not both. Multiple modifier keys _are_ possible in p5.js, but I can't remember how, atm. Use context7 to check for best practices

**Identifying best practices for multiple modifiers in p5.js****Selecting processing/p5.js for exploration****Investigating keyIsDown usage with modifiers****Considering external documentation sources****Refining multi-key detection approach**
```

```
**Reworking key press handling for Alt and Shift**
```

```
**Checking event usage and planning tests****Summarizing final response plan**

I'll acknowledge the request and describe the high-level approach I took—checking the docs (including the keyIsDown example), updating the detection to use KeyboardEvent.code with fallback to keyIsDown, confirming Option+Shift+S now works, and running tests to meet quality gates. I'll also include a snippet reference and optionally mention a tip about the event object before wrapping up.Confirmed the modifier combo issue, checked the p5.js reference for best practices, then reworked the shortcut detection to honor Shift + Alt + S while keeping the standard Shift + S save and reran the tests.

## actions taken
- Consulted the p5.js docs via Context7—the `keyIsDown()` reference explicitly shows combining multiple modifier checks with `&&`.
- Updated `p.keyPressed` in `dragline.js` to accept the `KeyboardEvent`, detect the physical `KeyS` via `event.code`, and require both `shiftKey` (or `keyIsDown(SHIFT)`) and `altKey`/`keyIsDown(ALT)` before toggling selection mode.
- Kept the Shift + S monochrome save path intact, but now it fires only when Alt isn’t held.

## tests
- `npm test` ✅ (existing suites, including `gridUtils.test.js`).

## notes
- With the `event.code === 'KeyS'` guard, Option/Alt no longer changes the key identity, so Shift + Option + S works reliably on macOS layouts while still respecting other platforms.

## requirements coverage
- Restore multi-modifier shortcut using documented `keyIsDown` pattern — **Done**.

in p5js, .get() has a simple syntax, but an extremely poor performance compared to .image(). The single use, here, is not going to be a source of any performance bottlenecks until we are auto-exporting animations. Note this issue in a backlog file.

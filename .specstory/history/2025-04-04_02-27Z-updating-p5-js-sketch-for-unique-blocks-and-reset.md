# Updating p5.js sketch for unique blocks and reset (2025-04-04 02:27Z)

_**User (2025-04-04 02:37Z)**_

This is a p5js sketch that uses the html canvas to display 10 text areas (or blocks) that can be moved around. Currently, 10 blocks are selected at random on page load. Let's update this in several ways:

1) The random selections cannot be repeated (that is, pick unique items)
2) allow the blocks to be cleared and replaced with a keystroke ("r")

---

_**Assistant**_

To implement the requested updates, we will make the following changes:

1. Modify the `setupTextAreas` function to ensure that the random selections are unique.
2. Add a new key event handler for the "r" key to clear and replace the blocks.

Here is the updated code:

```javascript
// ...existing code...

function setupTextAreas(textAreas) {
  const usedIndices = new Set(); // Track used indices to ensure uniqueness
  while (textAreas.length < 10) {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * blocks.default.length);
    if (!usedIndices.has(randomIndex)) {
      usedIndices.add(randomIndex);
      let lines = blocks.default[randomIndex].map(line =>
        line.replace(/ /g, fillChar)
      );
      textAreas.push({
        lines: lines,
        x: Math.floor((Math.random() * grid.cols) / 2),
        y: Math.floor((Math.random() * grid.rows) / 2),
        w: Math.max(...lines.map(line => line.length)),
        h: lines.length
      });
    }
  }
}

p.keyPressed = () => {
  if (p.key === 'i') {
    toggleInfoBox();
  }
  if (p.key === 'r') {
    // Clear and replace text areas
    textAreas.length = 0; // Clear the array
    setupTextAreas(textAreas); // Reinitialize with new unique blocks
    display(); // Redraw the grid
  }
  // ...existing key handling code for UP_ARROW and DOWN_ARROW...
};

// ...existing code...
``` 

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Unique Random Selection**:
   - A `Set` named `usedIndices` is introduced to track indices that have already been selected.
   - The `while` loop ensures that 10 unique blocks are added to `textAreas`.

2. **"r" Key Handling**:
   - When the "r" key is pressed, the `textAreas` array is cleared using `textAreas.length = 0`.
   - The `setupTextAreas` function is called again to populate the array with new unique blocks.
   - The `display` function is called to redraw the grid with the updated blocks.

This ensures that the blocks are unique on initialization and can be replaced dynamically with a keystroke.

---

_**User (2025-04-04 02:43Z)**_

Thanks!

Now, let's allow the user to add a new block (left-arrow key) or remove a block (right-arrow). As the block count is increased or decreased, pressing "r" will reset to the new block count.



---

_**Assistant**_

To allow the user to add a new block with the left-arrow key (`LEFT_ARROW`) and remove a block with the right-arrow key (`RIGHT_ARROW`), while ensuring that pressing "r" resets to the updated block count, we need to:

1. Track the current block count dynamically.
2. Update the `setupTextAreas` function to respect the current block count.
3. Add key handling for `LEFT_ARROW` and `RIGHT_ARROW` to increase or decrease the block count.

Here are the changes:

```javascript
// ...existing code...

let blockCount = 10; // Track the current number of blocks

function setupTextAreas(textAreas) {
  const usedIndices = new Set(); // Track used indices to ensure uniqueness
  while (textAreas.length < blockCount) {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * blocks.default.length);
    if (!usedIndices.has(randomIndex)) {
      usedIndices.add(randomIndex);
      let lines = blocks.default[randomIndex].map(line =>
        line.replace(/ /g, fillChar)
      );
      textAreas.push({
        lines: lines,
        x: Math.floor((Math.random() * grid.cols) / 2),
        y: Math.floor((Math.random() * grid.rows) / 2),
        w: Math.max(...lines.map(line => line.length)),
        h: lines.length
      });
    }
  }
}

p.keyPressed = () => {
  if (p.key === 'i') {
    toggleInfoBox();
  } else if (p.key === 'r') {
    // Clear and replace text areas with the current block count
    textAreas.length = 0; // Clear the array
    setupTextAreas(textAreas); // Reinitialize with new unique blocks
    display(); // Redraw the grid
  } else if (p.keyCode === p.LEFT_ARROW) {
    // Add a new block
    blockCount++;
    textAreas.length = 0; // Clear the array
    setupTextAreas(textAreas); // Reinitialize with the updated block count
    display(); // Redraw the grid
  } else if (p.keyCode === p.RIGHT_ARROW) {
    // Remove a block (minimum of 1 block)
    if (blockCount > 1) {
      blockCount--;
      textAreas.length = 0; // Clear the array
      setupTextAreas(textAreas); // Reinitialize with the updated block count
      display(); // Redraw the grid
    }
  }

  // Only handle key events if we're currently dragging a text area
  if (!dragging || selectedIndex === -1) return;

  // NOTE: down increases / up decreases
  // because lower text index has priority in display
  if (p.keyCode === p.DOWN_ARROW) {
    // Move the text area up in the array (if not already at the top)
    if (selectedIndex < textAreas.length - 1) {
      // Swap the current text area with the one above it
      [textAreas[selectedIndex], textAreas[selectedIndex + 1]] = [
        textAreas[selectedIndex + 1],
        textAreas[selectedIndex]
      ];
      // Update selectedIndex to follow the moved text area
      selectedIndex++;
      display();
    }
  } else if (p.keyCode === p.UP_ARROW) {
    // Move the text area down in the array (if not already at the bottom)
    if (selectedIndex > 0) {
      // Swap the current text area with the one below it
      [textAreas[selectedIndex], textAreas[selectedIndex - 1]] = [
        textAreas[selectedIndex - 1],
        textAreas[selectedIndex]
      ];
      // Update selectedIndex to follow the moved text area
      selectedIndex--;
      display();
    }
  }
};

// ...existing code...
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **`blockCount` Variable**:
   - Introduced a `blockCount` variable to track the current number of blocks dynamically. It starts at 10.

2. **Updated `setupTextAreas`**:
   - The function now uses `blockCount` to determine how many blocks to create.

3. **Key Handling for `LEFT_ARROW` and `RIGHT_ARROW`**:
   - Pressing `LEFT_ARROW` increases `blockCount` by 1, clears the existing blocks, and reinitializes with the new count.
   - Pressing `RIGHT_ARROW` decreases `blockCount` by 1 (with a minimum of 1 block), clears the existing blocks, and reinitializes with the new count.

4. **"r" Key Behavior**:
   - Pressing "r" resets the blocks to the current `blockCount`.

This ensures that the user can dynamically adjust the number of blocks and reset them as needed.

---

_**User (2025-04-04 02:49Z)**_

Nice!  However, when we add or remove blocks, we should not be changing the rest of the blocks. We need to keep the same set, with one new block, or removing only one block - maintaining all other info.

---

_**Assistant**_

To ensure that adding or removing blocks does not change the existing blocks, we need to modify the logic for handling `LEFT_ARROW` (add block) and `RIGHT_ARROW` (remove block). Instead of clearing and reinitializing all blocks, we will:

1. **Add a new block**: Generate one new block and append it to the `textAreas` array.
2. **Remove a block**: Remove the last block from the `textAreas` array.

Here is the updated code:

```javascript
p.keyPressed = () => {
  if (p.key === 'i') {
    toggleInfoBox();
  } else if (p.key === 'r') {
    // Reset blocks to the current block count
    textAreas.length = 0; // Clear the array
    setupTextAreas(textAreas); // Reinitialize with new unique blocks
    display(); // Redraw the grid
  } else if (p.keyCode === p.LEFT_ARROW) {
    // Add a new block
    if (textAreas.length < blocks.default.length) {
      const usedIndices = new Set(textAreas.map(area => area.index)); // Track used indices
      let randomIndex;
      do {
        randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * blocks.default.length);
      } while (usedIndices.has(randomIndex)); // Ensure uniqueness

      let lines = blocks.default[randomIndex].map(line =>
        line.replace(/ /g, fillChar)
      );
      textAreas.push({
        index: randomIndex, // Track the block's index for uniqueness
        lines: lines,
        x: Math.floor((Math.random() * grid.cols) / 2),
        y: Math.floor((Math.random() * grid.rows) / 2),
        w: Math.max(...lines.map(line => line.length)),
        h: lines.length
      });
      blockCount++;
      display(); // Redraw the grid
    }
  } else if (p.keyCode === p.RIGHT_ARROW) {
    // Remove the last block (minimum of 1 block)
    if (textAreas.length > 1) {
      textAreas.pop(); // Remove the last block
      blockCount--;
      display(); // Redraw the grid
    }
  }

  // Only handle key events if we're currently dragging a text area
  if (!dragging || selectedIndex === -1) return;

  // NOTE: down increases / up decreases
  // because lower text index has priority in display
  if (p.keyCode === p.DOWN_ARROW) {
    // Move the text area up in the array (if not already at the top)
    if (selectedIndex < textAreas.length - 1) {
      // Swap the current text area with the one above it
      [textAreas[selectedIndex], textAreas[selectedIndex + 1]] = [
        textAreas[selectedIndex + 1],
        textAreas[selectedIndex]
      ];
      // Update selectedIndex to follow the moved text area
      selectedIndex++;
      display();
    }
  } else if (p.keyCode === p.UP_ARROW) {
    // Move the text area down in the array (if not already at the bottom)
    if (selectedIndex > 0) {
      // Swap the current text area with the one below it
      [textAreas[selectedIndex], textAreas[selectedIndex - 1]] = [
        textAreas[selectedIndex - 1],
        textAreas[selectedIndex]
      ];
      // Update selectedIndex to follow the moved text area
      selectedIndex--;
      display();
    }
  }
};
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Adding a Block (`LEFT_ARROW`)**:
   - We track the indices of the blocks already in `textAreas` using a `Set`.
   - A new block is added by selecting a random index not already in use.
   - The new block is appended to the `textAreas` array without modifying the existing blocks.

2. **Removing a Block (`RIGHT_ARROW`)**:
   - The last block in the `textAreas` array is removed using `pop()`.
   - This ensures that only one block is removed, and the rest remain unchanged.

3. **Resetting Blocks (`r` Key)**:
   - The `textAreas` array is cleared and reinitialized with the current `blockCount`.
   - This behavior remains unchanged from the previous implementation.

This approach ensures that adding or removing blocks does not affect the existing blocks, maintaining their positions and content.

---

_**User (2025-04-04 02:52Z)**_

That looks good, but I'm worried that the code under LEFT_ARROW repeats code from setupTextAreas. I'm hoping to make more changes in the future, and would to do so in as few places as possible. Can you refactor so there is as little duplicate code as possible?

---

_**Assistant**_

To reduce duplication, we can refactor the code by extracting the logic for creating a single block into a reusable function. This function will handle generating a new block with unique content and positioning. Then, both `setupTextAreas` and the `LEFT_ARROW` key handler can use this function.

Here’s the refactored code:

```javascript
function createBlock(usedIndices) {
  let randomIndex;
  do {
    randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * blocks.default.length);
  } while (usedIndices.has(randomIndex)); // Ensure uniqueness

  usedIndices.add(randomIndex); // Track the used index

  let lines = blocks.default[randomIndex].map(line =>
    line.replace(/ /g, fillChar)
  );

  return {
    index: randomIndex, // Track the block's index for uniqueness
    lines: lines,
    x: Math.floor((Math.random() * grid.cols) / 2),
    y: Math.floor((Math.random() * grid.rows) / 2),
    w: Math.max(...lines.map(line => line.length)),
    h: lines.length
  };
}

function setupTextAreas(textAreas) {
  const usedIndices = new Set(textAreas.map(area => area.index)); // Track already used indices
  while (textAreas.length < blockCount) {
    textAreas.push(createBlock(usedIndices));
  }
}

p.keyPressed = () => {
  if (p.key === 'i') {
    toggleInfoBox();
  } else if (p.key === 'r') {
    // Reset blocks to the current block count
    textAreas.length = 0; // Clear the array
    setupTextAreas(textAreas); // Reinitialize with new unique blocks
    display(); // Redraw the grid
  } else if (p.keyCode === p.LEFT_ARROW) {
    // Add a new block
    if (textAreas.length < blocks.default.length) {
      const usedIndices = new Set(textAreas.map(area => area.index)); // Track used indices
      textAreas.push(createBlock(usedIndices)); // Add a new block
      blockCount++;
      display(); // Redraw the grid
    }
  } else if (p.keyCode === p.RIGHT_ARROW) {
    // Remove the last block (minimum of 1 block)
    if (textAreas.length > 1) {
      textAreas.pop(); // Remove the last block
      blockCount--;
      display(); // Redraw the grid
    }
  }

  // Only handle key events if we're currently dragging a text area
  if (!dragging || selectedIndex === -1) return;

  // NOTE: down increases / up decreases
  // because lower text index has priority in display
  if (p.keyCode === p.DOWN_ARROW) {
    // Move the text area up in the array (if not already at the top)
    if (selectedIndex < textAreas.length - 1) {
      [textAreas[selectedIndex], textAreas[selectedIndex + 1]] = [
        textAreas[selectedIndex + 1],
        textAreas[selectedIndex]
      ];
      selectedIndex++;
      display();
    }
  } else if (p.keyCode === p.UP_ARROW) {
    // Move the text area down in the array (if not already at the bottom)
    if (selectedIndex > 0) {
      [textAreas[selectedIndex], textAreas[selectedIndex - 1]] = [
        textAreas[selectedIndex - 1],
        textAreas[selectedIndex]
      ];
      selectedIndex--;
      display();
    }
  }
};
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **`createBlock` Function**:
   - This function encapsulates the logic for creating a single block.
   - It ensures the block's index is unique by checking against a `Set` of `usedIndices`.
   - It returns a new block object with all the necessary properties.

2. **Refactored `setupTextAreas`**:
   - The `setupTextAreas` function now uses `createBlock` to generate blocks, reducing duplication.

3. **Refactored `LEFT_ARROW` Key Handler**:
   - The `LEFT_ARROW` key handler also uses `createBlock` to add a new block, ensuring consistency with `setupTextAreas`.

### Benefits:
- The logic for creating a block is now centralized in the `createBlock` function.
- Any future changes to block creation (e.g., modifying positioning or content) need to be made in only one place.
- The code is cleaner and easier to maintain.

---

_**User (2025-04-04 03:37Z)**_

Thanks! 

So, when a textblock is created, it is created at a random position. The code is sub-optimal - it's currently placing everything into a random location starting in the upper-left quadrant.

While I like the clustering of a quadrant, the code should be updated so that, within a clustering distance, the blocks could be placed anywhere within the grid - but not extending past any of the borders.

Is this clear?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, it's clear! You want the blocks to still cluster within a certain distance but be distributed across the grid without exceeding the grid's boundaries. This means the random placement logic should allow for clustering while ensuring that blocks stay within the grid.

We can achieve this by introducing a "clustering distance" and modifying the random placement logic to ensure the blocks are placed within this distance while respecting the grid boundaries.

Here’s the updated `createBlock` function:

```javascript
function createBlock(usedIndices) {
  let randomIndex;
  do {
    randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * blocks.default.length);
  } while (usedIndices.has(randomIndex)); // Ensure uniqueness

  usedIndices.add(randomIndex); // Track the used index

  let lines = blocks.default[randomIndex].map(line =>
    line.replace(/ /g, fillChar)
  );

  const width = Math.max(...lines.map(line => line.length));
  const height = lines.length;

  // Define clustering distance (e.g., 25% of the grid size)
  const clusteringDistance = Math.floor(Math.min(grid.cols, grid.rows) * 0.25);

  // Generate random x and y positions within the clustering distance
  const x = Math.max(
    0,
    Math.min(
      grid.cols - width,
      Math.floor(Math.random() * clusteringDistance)
    )
  );
  const y = Math.max(
    0,
    Math.min(
      grid.rows - height,
      Math.floor(Math.random() * clusteringDistance)
    )
  );

  return {
    index: randomIndex, // Track the block's index for uniqueness
    lines: lines,
    x: x,
    y: y,
    w: width,
    h: height
  };
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Clustering Distance**:
   - A `clusteringDistance` is defined as a percentage (e.g., 25%) of the smaller dimension of the grid (`grid.cols` or `grid.rows`).
   - This ensures that blocks are placed within a limited area but still have some randomness.

2. **Random Placement with Boundaries**:
   - The `x` and `y` positions are calculated using `Math.random()` but are clamped to ensure they stay within the grid boundaries.
   - The `Math.max` and `Math.min` functions ensure that the block does not extend past the grid's borders.

3. **Dynamic Block Dimensions**:
   - The block's width (`w`) and height (`h`) are used to ensure that the block fits within the grid.

### Benefits:
- Blocks are still clustered but can appear anywhere within the grid, respecting the boundaries.
- The clustering distance can be easily adjusted by changing the percentage (e.g., `0.25` for 25%).
- The logic ensures that blocks do not overlap the grid's edges, even for larger blocks.

This approach provides the desired clustering behavior while maintaining flexibility and ensuring proper placement within the grid.

---

_**User (2025-04-04 03:40Z)**_

If clusteringDistance is set randomly inside of createBlock, but createBlock is called every time a block is created - how will this keep new blocks near each other?

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely correct—if `clusteringDistance` is set randomly inside `createBlock`, each block will have its own independent clustering logic, which won't ensure that new blocks are placed near each other. To maintain clustering, the `clusteringDistance` and the "center" of the cluster should be consistent across all blocks being created.

To fix this, we can:
1. Define a **cluster center** (e.g., `clusterCenterX` and `clusterCenterY`) and a **clustering distance** outside of `createBlock`.
2. Pass these values into `createBlock` so that all blocks are created relative to the same cluster center and clustering distance.

Here’s the updated implementation:

### Updated Code
```javascript
// Define cluster center and clustering distance globally
let clusterCenterX = 0;
let clusterCenterY = 0;
const clusteringDistance = 5; // Adjust this value to control clustering tightness

function createBlock(usedIndices) {
  let randomIndex;
  do {
    randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * blocks.default.length);
  } while (usedIndices.has(randomIndex)); // Ensure uniqueness

  usedIndices.add(randomIndex); // Track the used index

  let lines = blocks.default[randomIndex].map(line =>
    line.replace(/ /g, fillChar)
  );

  const width = Math.max(...lines.map(line => line.length));
  const height = lines.length;

  // Generate random x and y positions within the clustering distance
  const x = Math.max(
    0,
    Math.min(
      grid.cols - width,
      clusterCenterX + Math.floor((Math.random() - 0.5) * clusteringDistance)
    )
  );
  const y = Math.max(
    0,
    Math.min(
      grid.rows - height,
      clusterCenterY + Math.floor((Math.random() - 0.5) * clusteringDistance)
    )
  );

  return {
    index: randomIndex, // Track the block's index for uniqueness
    lines: lines,
    x: x,
    y: y,
    w: width,
    h: height
  };
}

function setupTextAreas(textAreas) {
  const usedIndices = new Set(textAreas.map(area => area.index)); // Track already used indices

  // Set a new cluster center for this setup
  clusterCenterX = Math.floor(Math.random() * grid.cols);
  clusterCenterY = Math.floor(Math.random() * grid.rows);

  while (textAreas.length < blockCount) {
    textAreas.push(createBlock(usedIndices));
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Cluster Center**:
   - `clusterCenterX` and `clusterCenterY` are defined globally and updated in `setupTextAreas` to a random position within the grid.
   - This ensures that all blocks created during a single setup are clustered around the same center.

2. **Clustering Distance**:
   - The `clusteringDistance` is a fixed value (e.g., `5` grid cells) that determines how tightly the blocks are clustered around the center.

3. **Random Placement Within Cluster**:
   - The `x` and `y` positions of each block are calculated relative to the cluster center, with a random offset within the `clusteringDistance`.
   - The `Math.max` and `Math.min` functions ensure that the blocks stay within the grid boundaries.

4. **Dynamic Cluster Center**:
   - Each time `setupTextAreas` is called (e.g., when resetting blocks with the "r" key), a new cluster center is chosen, creating a new cluster elsewhere in the grid.

### Benefits:
- All blocks created during a single setup are clustered around the same center.
- The clustering distance ensures that blocks are close to each other but still have some randomness.
- The logic ensures that blocks stay within the grid boundaries, even for larger blocks.
- The cluster center can be updated dynamically, allowing for different clusters in different setups.

This approach ensures that new blocks are consistently placed near each other while respecting the grid's boundaries.

_**User (2025-04-05 04:18Z)**_

text-grid-project was created as a stand-alone app in a sub-folder of dragline, with separate dependencies. I would like to migrate the app to be part of dragline, moving the code and adding the dependecies and new config files.

What would be the steps for this process? Ask me any questions before beginning.

---

_**Assistant**_

Here are the steps to migrate the `` into the `dragline` project while ensuring all dependencies, configurations, and code are properly integrated. I'll outline the process and ask clarifying questions where needed.

---

### Steps for Migration:

#### 1. **Move the Code**
   - Move the `` folder into the `dragline` project under a new subfolder, e.g., `dragline/text-grid`.
   - If there are other files in `` (e.g., `README.md`, `` folder), decide if they should also be moved.

#### 2. **Merge Dependencies**
   - Combine the dependencies and devDependencies from `package.json` into `package.json`.
   - Ensure there are no version conflicts. If there are, decide whether to:
     - Use the higher version.
     - Test compatibility with the existing code.

#### 3. **Update Scripts**
   - Add any relevant scripts from `package.json` (e.g., `"start": "node src/index.js"`) to `package.json`.
   - Update paths in the scripts to reflect the new location of the `text-grid` code (e.g., `dragline/text-grid/src/index.js`).

#### 4. **Update Configurations**
   - If `` has specific configurations (e.g., `.babelrc`, `.eslintrc`, etc.), merge them into the corresponding files in `dragline`. If `dragline` doesn't have these files, copy them over.
   - Ensure the configurations are compatible with the existing `dragline` setup.

#### 5. **Install Dependencies**
   - Run `npm install` in the `dragline` project root to install the combined dependencies.

#### 6. **Test the Integration**
   - Run the `text-grid` app from its new location (e.g., `node text-grid/src/index.js`) to ensure it works as expected.
   - Test the existing `dragline` app to ensure no functionality is broken.

#### 7. **Clean Up**
   - Remove the old `` folder after confirming everything works in its new location.

---

### Questions Before Proceeding:
1. **Folder Structure**:
   - Should the `text-grid` code be placed in a specific subfolder of `dragline` (e.g., `dragline/text-grid`)?
   - Are there any files in `` (e.g., `sample.tumble.js`) that should not be moved?

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Are there any specific dependencies in `` that you know might conflict with `dragline`'s dependencies? (e.g., `jest` is already in both projects but might have different versions.)

3. **Scripts**:
   - Do you want to keep the `text-grid` app runnable as a standalone script (e.g., `node text-grid/src/index.js`), or should it be fully integrated into the `dragline` app?

4. **Configurations**:
   - Are there any custom configurations in `` (e.g., `.babelrc`, `.eslintrc`) that need to be merged into `dragline`?

5. **Testing**:
   - Do you have tests for `` that need to be run after migration? Should they be integrated into `dragline`'s test suite?

Let me know your preferences, and I can provide detailed instructions or code snippets for each step!

1. Let's put text-grid under src/text-grid
2. No known conflicts. If jest in text-grid is newer, use that.
3. It should be fully integrated. However, only the index.js file is standalone and contains no logic.
4. please migrate babel.config.js and jest.config.js
5. Please integrate the tests from the tests folder. However, I don't think that dragline has any tests of its own.

_**Assistant**_

Thanks for the clarifications! Based on your input, here’s the detailed plan for migrating `` into `dragline`:

---

### Migration Steps:

#### 1. **Move the Code**
   - Move the `` folder into `dragline/src/text-grid`.
   - If there is a `tests` folder in ``, move it to `dragline/tests/text-grid`.

#### 2. **Merge Dependencies**
   - Open `package.json` and merge the dependencies and devDependencies from `package.json`:
     - Add `"lodash": "^4.17.21"` to `dependencies`.
     - Add `"@babel/core": "^7.26.10"`, `"@babel/preset-env": "^7.26.9"`, and `"babel-jest": "^29.7.0"` to `devDependencies`.
     - Use the newer version of `jest` from `` (`"jest": "^29.7.0"`).
   - Remove `package.json` after merging.

#### 3. **Update Scripts**
   - Add the `start` script from `` to `package.json`:
     ```json
     "start": "node src/text-grid/index.js"
     ```
   - Remove the `start` script from `package.json`.

#### 4. **Migrate Babel and Jest Configurations**
   - Move `babel.config.js` and `jest.config.js` from `` to the root of `dragline`.
   - If `dragline` already has these files, merge the configurations:
     - For `babel.config.js`, ensure it includes the `@babel/preset-env` preset.
     - For `jest.config.js`, ensure it includes the necessary configuration for `text-grid`.

#### 5. **Integrate Tests**
   - Move the `tests` folder from `` to `dragline/tests/text-grid`.
   - Update the `jest.config.js` file to include the new test paths (if necessary).
   - Run `npm test` to ensure the tests work in the new structure.

#### 6. **Install Dependencies**
   - Run `npm install` in the `dragline` project root to install the merged dependencies.

#### 7. **Test the Integration**
   - Run the `start` script (`npm start`) to ensure the `text-grid` app works as expected.
   - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass.

#### 8. **Clean Up**
   - Remove the `` folder after confirming everything works in its new location.

### Example of Updated `package.json`:
Here’s how the updated `package.json` might look after merging:

```json
{
  "name": "dragline",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build --emptyOutDir",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist --nojekyll",
    "publish": "npm run build && npm run deploy",
    "open": "open https://michaelpaulukonis.github.io/dragline",
    "start": "node src/text-grid/index.js",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "gh-pages": "^6.3.0",
    "jest": "^29.7.0",
    "vite": "^6.2.3",
    "@babel/core": "^7.26.10",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.26.9",
    "babel-jest": "^29.7.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.7.7",
    "cheerio": "^1.0.0",
    "p5": "^1.11.1",
    "p5js-wrapper": "^1.2.3",
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  }
}
```

### Questions for Final Confirmation:
1. Should the `tests` folder be placed under `dragline/tests/text-grid`, or do you prefer a different location?
2. Do you want me to provide specific content for `babel.config.js` and `jest.config.js` if they need to be merged or created from scratch?

Let me know if you'd like me to generate any specific files or code snippets for this process!

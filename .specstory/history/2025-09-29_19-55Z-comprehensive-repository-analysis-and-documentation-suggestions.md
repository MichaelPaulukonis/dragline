Plan: (1) Map the current product, architecture, and structure; (2) assess tooling, workflow, documentation, and health; (3) curate actionable recommendations, templates, and extras (quick start, contacts, resources, roadmap).

## Repository Snapshot

### 1. Project Overview
- **Project name & purpose:** `dragline` is an experimental text-art canvas that renders clusters of monospaced text blocks on an HTML5 canvas, enabling users to drag, rearrange, recolor, and regenerate poetic snippets fetched from Tumblr or a local fallback dataset.
- **Technology stack:** Vite + vanilla ES modules, p5.js via `p5js-wrapper`, Tailwind-free custom CSS, Axios for Tumblr API calls, Jest/Babel for tests, GitHub Pages deployment. Supplementary prototype tooling lives in `` and ``.
- **Project type:** Browser-based creative web app (single-page, canvas-heavy visualization).
- **Target audience:** The author/creator community (poetic coders, digital artists) experimenting with textual landscapes.
- **Current status:** Early-stage prototype. Core interaction works, but comments, TODOs, and sparse tests indicate ongoing experimentation rather than production readiness.

### 2. Architecture Summary
- **Overall architecture:** Client-only SPA served by Vite. The entry module `dragline.js` bootstraps a single p5 instance, orchestrates text-block creation, manages UI interactions, and coordinates fetching.
- **Key components:**
  - `dragline.js`: Main orchestration (fetching corpus, initializing canvas, handling input, rendering).
  - `text-grid/`: Tokenizes corpus, builds 40×40 grids, then splits into 20×20 chunks that become draggable blocks.
  - `blocks.js`: Encapsulates block instantiation, clustering logic, and z-index sequencing.
  - `grid.js`: Maintains the character grid backing the canvas render.
  - `tumblr-random.js`: Pulls content via Tumblr API and falls back to local JSON.
  - `infobox.js` + `css/*.css`: Moveable instruction overlay and styling.
- **Data flow:** Tumblr API → raw HTML bodies → DOMParser cleanup → plain text corpus → tokenization (`tokenizer.js`) → grids (`gridBuilder.js` → `splitter.js`) → block objects (`blocks.js`) → `dragline.js` renders onto canvas using `grid.js` helpers. User input updates in-memory block list, triggering re-render.
- **External dependencies:** Tumblr REST API (no auth proxy, public key baked in), p5.js rendering pipeline, Axios HTTP client; Cheerio is listed but unused.
- **Design patterns:** Functional decomposition with module-scoped state; procedural UI control rather than React-style state management. Canvas rendering loops rely on manual redraw (`display()`) triggered by events.

### 3. Repository Structure Analysis
- **Directory organization:**
  - ``: Production code grouped by concern (`dragline.js`, helpers, text-grid pipeline).
  - ``: Core styling + overlay.
  - ``: Font asset.
  - ``: Jest suite (single grid-builder test file).
  - ``: Stage-gate instructions, backlog scaffolding, reference notes.
  - `` & ``: Prototypes/legacy experiments.
- **Key files:** `dragline.js`, `src/text-grid/*`, `blocks.js`, `tumblr-random.js`, `index.html`, `package.json`, `vite.config.js`.
- **Configuration:** Vite config sets GitHub Pages base, Babel preset-env for Jest, Jest config uses `babel-jest` with Node environment, `package.json` powers scripts and GH Pages deployment.
- **Entry points:** `index.html` loads `dragline.js` (primary) and `infobox.js`. Vite handles bundling.
- **Build & deploy:** `npm run build` (Vite) → ``, `npm run deploy` publishes via `gh-pages` to GitHub Pages. No CI/CD scripts present; deployment is manual via npm script.

### 4. Feature Analysis
- **Core features:** Canvas-based text block rendering, draggable interactions, keyboard shortcuts (move, delete, reorder, reset, fetch new data, toggle info box, export snapshot), gradient background.
- **User workflows:** Launch app → view randomized poem fragments → drag into new layout → fetch new Tumblr content (`n`) → save screenshot (`Shift+S`).
- **API endpoints:** Tumblr blog posts endpoints (`/v2/blog/{blogName}/posts`) consumed directly from the browser; no backend wrappers.
- **Database schema:** None. Text blocks are ephemeral client-side objects; fallback data stored as JSON.
- **Authentication:** None. Tumblr API key embedded publicly; no auth for users.

### 5. Development Setup
- **Prerequisites:** Node.js ≥18 (for Vite 6 compatibility), npm. Optional global `gh-pages` CLI not required because script bundles it.
- **Installation:** `npm install` → `npm run dev` to launch Vite dev server → open `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).
- **Workflow:** Manual experimentation. No lint/codestyle tooling; developers rely on Vite HMR and console logs. Stage-gate docs suggest a structured planning process, but it’s not yet enacted.
- **Testing strategy:** Jest with Babel transform; only `buildGrid.test.js` exists (covers text-grid builder). No integration/UI/end-to-end tests.
- **Code quality gates:** No ESLint/Prettier config. Randomized behaviors complicate determinism. No automated CI lint/test pipeline.

### 6. Documentation Assessment
- **README quality:** Intro + brief TODO; lacks setup, architecture, usage, contributing details. Supplemental template README exists but not integrated.
- **Code documentation:** Limited inline comments; main modules rely on descriptive variable names. No formal JSDoc.
- **API documentation:** None beyond code-level hints; Tumblr usage undocumented.
- **Architecture docs:** `analysis.md` captures prior AI feedback; no comprehensive architecture guide.
- **User documentation:** Info box in-app is detailed; repository docs lack user guide or screenshot.

### 7. Missing Documentation Suggestions
- **PRD:** Create `/docs/requirements/PRD.md` that links from README and outlines product goals, personas, success metrics.
- **ADRs:** Establish `/docs/decisions/` with ADR template (why p5.js, why Tumblr API, handling of randomization).
- **API documentation:** `/docs/api/` describing Tumblr fetch contract, rate limits, key management, and any future internal APIs.
- **Deployment guide:** `/docs/deployment/guide.md` detailing GitHub Pages workflow, environment variables, handling of Tumblr key, and potential staging setup.
- **Changelog:** Add root `CHANGELOG.md` following Keep-a-Changelog to track iterations (especially given experimental nature).

### 8. Technical Debt and Improvements
- **Code quality issues:** Monolithic `dragline.js` (≈480 lines) mixing rendering, input, data fetching. Random logic in tests introduces flakiness. `tumblr-random.js` returns unresolved promise chains without robust error catching beyond initial fetch.
- **Performance concerns:** Grid is fully regenerated frequently; `populateCharGrid` clears/resets entire grid. Randomization occurs on every fetch with synchronous loops—fine now but could lag on larger grids. Canvas redraw occurs on every key press even if unchanged.
- **Security considerations:** Hardcoded Tumblr API key in client bundle exposes secret; no rate-limit handling. Exposed DOMParser use implies CORS reliance on Tumblr’s permissive policy.
- **Scalability issues:** All data held in-memory; additional features (e.g., undo/redo) would need state snapshots. Block creation duplicates arrays (`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify)`). Lack of virtualization if grids scale.
- **Dependency management:** Cheerio unused; remove or explain. Vite 6 is future release—keep an eye on compatibility; `p5js-wrapper` maintenance status should be checked. Prototype directories may confuse dependency graph.

### 9. Project Health Metrics (qualitative)
- **Code complexity:** Medium; logic is understandable but tightly coupled. Modularization helps but there’s room to split responsibilities.
- **Test coverage:** Very low (single file). Core interactive logic untested.
- **Documentation coverage:** Sparse; operational knowledge mainly in code and TODOs.
- **Maintainability:** Moderate difficulty due to random behavior, lack of abstractions, and absence of type safety.
- **Technical debt level:** Noticeable. Experimentation stage with multiple TODOs and prototype leftovers; debt manageable but should be addressed before scaling.

### 10. Recommendations and Next Steps
- **Critical issues:**
  - Remove or proxy the embedded Tumblr API key; switch to environment variables with serverless proxy or limited-scope key.
  - Add graceful error handling and user feedback when Tumblr fetch fails (currently silent aside from console).
- **Documentation improvements:**
  - Rewrite README with setup, usage, architecture diagram, shortcuts, and deployment instructions.
  - Add PRD/ADR/Deployment docs as outlined above.
  - Document Tumblr interaction (rate limits, fallback behavior).
- **Code quality:**
  - Break `dragline.js` into submodules (input controller, renderer, state manager).
  - Introduce ESLint + Prettier for consistent style.
  - Refactor `populateCharGrid` to update only changed cells; consider differential rendering.
- **Feature gaps:**
  - Provide UI toggles for fill characters, background themes, and block counts.
  - Add undo/redo, improved z-index controls, overlap detection.
  - Offer local text upload to diversify corpus beyond Tumblr.
- **Infrastructure:**
  - Add CI workflow (GitHub Actions) running `npm test` and future lint tasks.
  - Consider bundling preview with Vite’s static adapter for deployment or migrating to Netlify/Vercel for easier env handling.
  - Introduce logging instrumentation for fetch failures.

**Preparing documentation addition**

I'm organizing the high-level analysis into a structured markdown document under docs/reference, planning the file content with proper headings and a concise preamble before creating the new file. I'll ensure the document clearly presents the repository snapshot and includes a simple plan outline.Saved the comprehensive repository snapshot to `dragline-repository-snapshot.md`, covering the full analysis and recommendations you requested. Tests weren’t run because this update was documentation-only. Let me know if you’d like the README or other docs updated to reference this new snapshot.

_**Assistant (copilot/gpt-5-codex)**_

**Updating copilot-instructions.md to reflect current stack**

I’m preparing to rewrite the copilot-instructions.md to accurately describe the actual tech stack—Vite, p5, Axios, and vanilla JS modules—instead of outdated Next.js info. I’ll draft new sections covering project context, coding standards, testing, build commands, and deployment, then use apply_patch to replace the file wholesale. This should help keep instructions relevant and clear for contributors.**Creating new file****Verifying file deletion status****Updating file with apply_patch**
```

```
**Preparing response summary**Updated `copilot-instructions.md` to reflect the real Vite+p5.js JavaScript stack, current directory layout, coding/testing practices, and deployment workflow described in the new repository snapshot. No tests were run since this was documentation-only. Let me know if you’d like to cross-link these instructions from other docs or add more detail.

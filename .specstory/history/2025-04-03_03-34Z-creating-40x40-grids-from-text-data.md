# Creating 40x40 grids from text data (2025-04-03 03:34Z)

_**User (2025-04-03 03:40Z)**_

blocks.json contains "grids" - arrays containing 20 lines of 20 characters. They are very "spacious" - they contain lots of spaces. I am looking to create more grids like these (arrays of 20 lines of 20 characters) from other texts, such as those in "sample.tumble.js".

I want us to ingest the texts, tokenize them, then build 40x40 grids with random amounts of space between the tokens. The 40x40 grids should then be split into 4 20x20 grids.

Do you have any questions?

_**Assistant**_

Sure, here's a proposed directory structure for a JavaScript project:

_**User (2025-04-03 03:54Z)**_

Thanks! it looks like "gridBuilder" is ending up in an infinite loop. What might be causing this? Can you build some tests for this?

I am a little confused how tokens are placed into the grid. Tokens are multi-character strings, but the placement is on a row/column single-character basis?

---

_**Assistant**_

The issue with the infinite loop in `gridBuilder.js` is likely due to the fact that the function attempts to place tokens into random positions in the grid, but once the grid is filled with tokens, it continues to loop indefinitely because it cannot find any empty spaces (`' '`) to place the remaining tokens.

Additionally, you're correct that the current implementation assumes tokens are single characters, but if tokens are multi-character strings, this logic will not work as intended. Multi-character tokens would require contiguous space in the grid, which the current implementation does not account for.

### Fixing the Code
To address these issues:
1. Ensure that tokens are placed as contiguous strings in the grid.
2. Avoid infinite loops by checking if there is enough space in the grid for all tokens before attempting placement.

Here’s an updated version of the `buildGrid` function:

```javascript
export function buildGrid(tokens) {
  const gridSize = 40;
  const grid = Array.from({ length: gridSize }, () => Array(gridSize).fill(' '));
  const tokenCount = tokens.length;

  // Check if there is enough space in the grid for all tokens
  const totalGridSpaces = gridSize * gridSize;
  const totalTokenLength = tokens.reduce((sum, token) => sum + token.length, 0);
  if (totalTokenLength > totalGridSpaces) {
    throw new Error('Not enough space in the grid for all tokens.');
  }

  tokens.forEach((token) => {
    let placed = false;

    while (!placed) {
      const row = Math.floor(Math.random() * gridSize);
      const col = Math.floor(Math.random() * gridSize);

      // Check if the token fits in the current row starting at the column
      if (col + token.length <= gridSize && grid[row].slice(col, col + token.length).every((cell) => cell === ' ')) {
        for (let i = 0; i < token.length; i++) {
          grid[row][col + i] = token[i];
        }
        placed = true;
      }
    }
  });

  return grid;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Space Check**: Before placing tokens, the function calculates the total space required by all tokens and compares it to the available grid space.
2. **Contiguous Placement**: Tokens are placed as contiguous strings in a row, ensuring that multi-character tokens fit properly.
3. **Avoid Infinite Loop**: The function ensures that tokens are only placed where there is enough space, avoiding the infinite loop issue.

---

### Unit Tests
Here are some unit tests to verify the functionality of the `buildGrid` function:

```javascript
import { buildGrid } from '../src/gridBuilder';

describe('buildGrid', () => {
  test('should create a grid with all tokens placed', () => {
    const tokens = ['hello', 'world', 'test'];
    const grid = buildGrid(tokens);

    // Check that all tokens are placed in the grid
    tokens.forEach((token) => {
      const gridString = grid.map((row) => row.join('')).join('\n');
      expect(gridString).toContain(token);
    });
  });

  test('should throw an error if tokens cannot fit in the grid', () => {
    const tokens = Array(2000).fill('longtoken'); // Too many tokens to fit in a 40x40 grid
    expect(() => buildGrid(tokens)).toThrow('Not enough space in the grid for all tokens.');
  });

  test('should not overwrite existing tokens', () => {
    const tokens = ['abc', 'def', 'ghi'];
    const grid = buildGrid(tokens);

    // Ensure no token overwrites another
    const gridString = grid.map((row) => row.join('')).join('\n');
    tokens.forEach((token) => {
      const occurrences = (gridString.match(new RegExp(token, 'g')) || []).length;
      expect(occurrences).toBe(1);
    });
  });
});
```

### Running the Tests
To run the tests, you can use a testing framework like Jest. Install Jest if you haven’t already:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Then, add a test script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

Run the tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

_**User (2025-04-03 04:02Z)**_

Hrm, having some trouble running the test: SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module

---

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because Node.js does not recognize ES module syntax (`import/export`) by default unless explicitly configured. Here's how you can fix it:

### Solution 1: Use `"type": "module"` in `package.json`
Add the following to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

This tells Node.js to treat all `.js` files as ES modules. After adding this, you should be able to use `import` and `export` without issues.

---

### Solution 2: Rename Files to `.mjs`
If you don't want to modify `package.json`, rename your files to use the `.mjs` extension (e.g., `gridBuilder.mjs` and `buildGrid.test.mjs`). Node.js treats `.mjs` files as ES modules by default.

---

### Solution 3: Use CommonJS Syntax
If you prefer not to use ES modules, you can rewrite your code to use CommonJS syntax (`require` and `module.exports`). For example:

**gridBuilder.js**
```javascript
function buildGrid(tokens) {
  const gridSize = 40;
  const grid = Array.from({ length: gridSize }, () => Array(gridSize).fill(' '));
  const tokenCount = tokens.length;

  const totalGridSpaces = gridSize * gridSize;
  const totalTokenLength = tokens.reduce((sum, token) => sum + token.length, 0);
  if (totalTokenLength > totalGridSpaces) {
    throw new Error('Not enough space in the grid for all tokens.');
  }

  tokens.forEach((token) => {
    let placed = false;

    while (!placed) {
      const row = Math.floor(Math.random() * gridSize);
      const col = Math.floor(Math.random() * gridSize);

      if (col + token.length <= gridSize && grid[row].slice(col, col + token.length).every((cell) => cell === ' ')) {
        for (let i = 0; i < token.length; i++) {
          grid[row][col + i] = token[i];
        }
        placed = true;
      }
    }
  });

  return grid;
}

module.exports = { buildGrid };
```

**buildGrid.test.js**
```javascript
const { buildGrid } = require('../src/gridBuilder');

describe('buildGrid', () => {
  test('should create a grid with all tokens placed', () => {
    const tokens = ['hello', 'world', 'test'];
    const grid = buildGrid(tokens);

    tokens.forEach((token) => {
      const gridString = grid.map((row) => row.join('')).join('\n');
      expect(gridString).toContain(token);
    });
  });

  test('should throw an error if tokens cannot fit in the grid', () => {
    const tokens = Array(2000).fill('longtoken');
    expect(() => buildGrid(tokens)).toThrow('Not enough space in the grid for all tokens.');
  });

  test('should not overwrite existing tokens', () => {
    const tokens = ['abc', 'def', 'ghi'];
    const grid = buildGrid(tokens);

    const gridString = grid.map((row) => row.join('')).join('\n');
    tokens.forEach((token) => {
      const occurrences = (gridString.match(new RegExp(token, 'g')) || []).length;
      expect(occurrences).toBe(1);
    });
  });
});
```

---

### Solution 4: Configure Jest for ES Modules
If you want to keep using ES modules, configure Jest to support them. Add the following to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "jest": {
    "transform": {}
  }
}
```

Then, install the `esm` package:

```bash
npm install esm
```

Run Jest with the `--experimental-vm-modules` flag:

```bash
node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/.bin/jest
```

---

### Recommendation
The easiest solution is **Solution 1** (add `"type": "module"` to `package.json`). It allows you to use modern ES module syntax without additional configuration.

---

_**User (2025-04-03 04:04Z)**_

Thanks! However, "type": "module" is alreay in package.json

---

_**Assistant**_

Since `"type": "module"` is already set in your `package.json`, the issue might be related to how Jest is configured. By default, Jest does not fully support ES modules without additional setup. Here's how you can fix it:

### Solution: Configure Jest for ES Modules

1. **Install `babel-jest` and Babel Preset**
   Install the necessary packages to enable Jest to handle ES modules:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
   ```

2. **Create a Babel Configuration File**
   Add a `.babelrc` file or `babel.config.json` in the root of your project with the following content:

   ```json
   {
     "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
   }
   ```

3. **Update Jest Configuration**
   Add a `jest.config.js` file in the root of your project with the following content:

   ```javascript
   // filepath: /Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/dragline/text-grid-project/jest.config.js
   export default {
     transform: {
       "^.+\\.js$": "babel-jest"
     }
   };
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   Now, you should be able to run your tests using the `npm test` command:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

---

### Explanation
- **`babel-jest`**: Allows Jest to transform ES module syntax into a format it can understand.
- **`@babel/preset-env`**: Ensures compatibility with modern JavaScript features.
- **`jest.config.js`**: Configures Jest to use `babel-jest` for transforming `.js` files.

This setup should resolve the `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` issue while keeping your project as an ES module.

_**User (2025-04-03 04:06Z)**_

That was perfect, thanks!

---

_**Assistant**_

You're welcome! I'm glad it worked for you. Let me know if you need help with anything else. Happy coding! 🚀

_**User (2025-04-03 04:10Z)**_

Now, let's go back to gridBuilder. I am guessing that much of the time more tokens than can fit will be passed in. Rather that erroring out, the method should either 1) fit just some of them or 2) make multiple grids.

Additionally, there should be plenty of space between the elements, do not pack them in.

Instead of the current positioning system, I would prefer it if the token were added in sequence, with random amounts of space added between the tokens. If a token exends past the edge of the grid, it will be split at that point and start fresh on the next line. The randomness of the amount of space should be configurable, but let's start with 50% space. That is, half text tokens, half spaces.

Please ask any questions before beginning.

---

_**Assistant**_

Got it! Here's a summary of your requirements and my understanding:

### Requirements:
1. **Handle Excess Tokens**:
   - If more tokens are passed than can fit in one grid, the function should:
     - Either fit as many as possible into one grid.
     - Or create multiple grids to accommodate all tokens.

2. **Add Random Space Between Tokens**:
   - Tokens should be added sequentially with random amounts of space between them.
   - The randomness of the space should be configurable (e.g., 50% space by default).

3. **Split Tokens Across Lines**:
   - If a token extends past the edge of the grid, it should be split at that point and continue on the next line.

4. **Configurable Space Ratio**:
   - The ratio of spaces to text should be adjustable, starting with a default of 50% (half spaces, half text).

---

### Questions:
1. Should the function return a single grid if all tokens fit, or always return an array of grids (even if there's only one)?
2. How should the space ratio be passed to the function? As a parameter (e.g., `spaceRatio = 0.5`)?
3. Should the grids be fixed at 40x40, or should the size also be configurable?

Let me know if you'd like to clarify or adjust anything before I proceed!

---

_**User (2025-04-03 04:12Z)**_

1. For consistency let's always return an array, which contains one or more grids.
2. let's pass in a parameter as you suggested
3. it can be fixed for now

---

_**Assistant**_

Thanks for clarifying! Here's the updated plan for the `buildGrid` function:

---

### Updated Requirements:
1. **Return an Array of Grids**:
   - Always return an array, even if there is only one grid.

2. **Configurable Space Ratio**:
   - Add a parameter `spaceRatio` (default: `0.5`) to control the ratio of spaces to text.

3. **Sequential Token Placement**:
   - Tokens are placed sequentially with random spaces between them.
   - If a token extends past the edge of the grid, it will be split and continued on the next line.

4. **Handle Excess Tokens**:
   - If tokens cannot fit in one grid, create additional grids as needed.

5. **Fixed Grid Size**:
   - Grids remain fixed at 40x40.

---

### Updated Code
Here’s the revised `buildGrid` function:

```javascript
export function buildGrid(tokens, spaceRatio = 0.5) {
  const gridSize = 40;
  const grids = [];
  let currentGrid = Array.from({ length: gridSize }, () => Array(gridSize).fill(' '));
  let row = 0;
  let col = 0;

  const addTokenToGrid = (token) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < token.length; i++) {
      if (col >= gridSize) {
        // Move to the next row if the token exceeds the current row
        col = 0;
        row++;
      }

      if (row >= gridSize) {
        // If the current grid is full, start a new grid
        grids.push(currentGrid);
        currentGrid = Array.from({ length: gridSize }, () => Array(gridSize).fill(' '));
        row = 0;
        col = 0;
      }

      currentGrid[row][col] = token[i];
      col++;
    }
  };

  const addSpacesToGrid = (spaceCount) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < spaceCount; i++) {
      if (col >= gridSize) {
        col = 0;
        row++;
      }

      if (row >= gridSize) {
        grids.push(currentGrid);
        currentGrid = Array.from({ length: gridSize }, () => Array(gridSize).fill(' '));
        row = 0;
        col = 0;
      }

      currentGrid[row][col] = ' ';
      col++;
    }
  };

  tokens.forEach((token) => {
    // Add random spaces before the token
    const spaceCount = Math.floor(Math.random() * (spaceRatio * gridSize));
    addSpacesToGrid(spaceCount);

    // Add the token itself
    addTokenToGrid(token);
  });

  // Push the last grid if it has content
  grids.push(currentGrid);

  return grids;
}
```

---

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Sequential Placement**:
   - Tokens are placed one after another, with random spaces added before each token.
   - If a token exceeds the row's boundary, it wraps to the next row.
   - If the grid is full, a new grid is created.

2. **Random Space Handling**:
   - The `spaceRatio` parameter controls the randomness of spaces. For example, `spaceRatio = 0.5` means half the grid will be spaces on average.

3. **Multiple Grids**:
   - If tokens cannot fit in one grid, additional grids are created.

4. **Helper Functions**:
   - `addTokenToGrid`: Handles token placement, including wrapping and grid overflow.
   - `addSpacesToGrid`: Handles adding spaces, ensuring proper wrapping and overflow handling.

---

### Example Usage:
```javascript
const tokens = ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'test'];
const grids = buildGrid(tokens, 0.5);

console.log(grids);
```

---

### Next Steps:
Would you like me to write unit tests for this updated function?

---

_**User (2025-04-03 04:13Z)**_

Yes, let's write unit-tests

---

_**Assistant**_

Here are unit tests for the updated `buildGrid` function. These tests ensure that the function behaves as expected under various scenarios.

---

### Unit Tests

```javascript
import { buildGrid } from '../src/gridBuilder';

describe('buildGrid', () => {
  test('should create a single grid when all tokens fit', () => {
    const tokens = ['hello', 'world', 'test'];
    const grids =Grid(tokens, 0.5);

    // Ensure only one grid is created
    expect(grids.length).toBe(1);

    // Ensure all tokens are present in the grid
    const gridString = grids[0].map((row) => row.join('')).join('\n');
    tokens.forEach((token) => {
      expect(gridString).toContain(token);
    });
  });

  test('should create multiple grids when tokens exceed one grid', () => {
    const tokens = Array(200).fill('longtoken'); // Too many tokens for one grid
    const grids = buildGrid(tokens, 0.5);

    // Ensure multiple grids are created
    expect(grids.length).toBeGreaterThan(1);

    // Ensure all tokens are placed across grids
    const allGridsString = grids.map((grid) => grid.map((row) => row.join('')).join('\n')).join('\n');
    tokens.forEach((token) => {
      expect(allGridsString).toContain(token);
    });
  });

  test('should split tokens across lines if they exceed the row boundary', () => {
    const tokens = ['thisisaverylongtoken']; // A single token longer than a row
    const grids = buildGrid(tokens, 0.5);

    // Ensure the token is split across multiple rows
    const gridString = grids[0].map((row) => row.join('')).join('\n');
    expect(gridString).toContain('thisisaverylongtoken'.slice(0, 40)); // First part of the token
    expect(gridString).toContain('thisisaverylongtoken'.slice(40)); // Remaining part of the token
  });

  test('should add random spaces between tokens', () => {
    const tokens = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
    const grids = buildGrid(tokens, 0.5);

    // Ensure there are spaces between tokens
    const gridString = grids[0].map((row) => row.join('')).join('');
    const tokenPositions = tokens.map((token) => gridString.indexOf(token));
    expect(tokenPositions[1]).toBeGreaterThan(tokenPositions[0] + 1); // Space between 'a' and 'b'
    expect(tokenPositions[2]).toBeGreaterThan(tokenPositions[1] + 1); // Space between 'b' and 'c'
  });

  test('should respect the spaceRatio parameter', () => {
    const tokens = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
    const grids = buildGrid(tokens, 0.8); // 80% spaces

    // Count spaces and non-space characters
    const gridString = grids[0].map((row) => row.join('')).join('');
    const spaceCount = (gridString.match(/ /g) || []).length;
    const nonSpaceCount = gridString.length - spaceCount;

    // Ensure the ratio of spaces to non-spaces is approximately 80%
    expect(spaceCount / (spaceCount + nonSpaceCount)).toBeCloseTo(0.8, 1);
  });
});
```

---

### Explanation of Tests

1. **Single Grid Test**:
   - Verifies that a single grid is created when all tokens fit within one grid.
   - Ensures all tokens are present in the grid.

2. **Multiple Grids Test**:
   - Verifies that multiple grids are created when tokens exceed the capacity of one grid.
   - Ensures all tokens are placed across the grids.

3. **Token Splitting Test**:
   - Verifies that tokens are split across lines if they exceed the row boundary.

4. **Random Spaces Test**:
   - Ensures that random spaces are added between tokens.

5. **Space Ratio Test**:
   - Verifies that the `spaceRatio` parameter is respected by checking the ratio of spaces to non-space characters.

---

### Running the Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute the tests using Jest and report any failures.

_**User (2025-04-03 04:23Z)**_

Looking good!

However, can we  concatenate the grid rows so they are single 40-character strings?

---

_**Assistant**_

Certainly! To concatenate the rows of each grid into single 40-character strings, we can modify the `buildGrid` function to process each grid before returning it. Here's the updated code:

---

### Updated Code

```javascript
export function buildGrid(tokens, spaceRatio = 0.5) {
  const gridSize = 40;
  const grids = [];
  let currentGrid = Array.from({ length: gridSize }, () => Array(gridSize).fill(' '));
  let row = 0;
  let col = 0;

  const addTokenToGrid = (token) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < token.length; i++) {
      if (col >= gridSize) {
        // Move to the next row if the token exceeds the current row
        col = 0;
        row++;
      }

      if (row >= gridSize) {
        // If the current grid is full, start a new grid
        grids.push(currentGrid);
        currentGrid = Array.from({ length: gridSize }, () => Array(gridSize).fill(' '));
        row = 0;
        col = 0;
      }

      currentGrid[row][col] = token[i];
      col++;
    }
  };

  const addSpacesToGrid = (spaceCount) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < spaceCount; i++) {
      if (col >= gridSize) {
        col = 0;
        row++;
      }

      if (row >= gridSize) {
        grids.push(currentGrid);
        currentGrid = Array.from({ length: gridSize }, () => Array(gridSize).fill(' '));
        row = 0;
        col = 0;
      }

      currentGrid[row][col] = ' ';
      col++;
    }
  };

  tokens.forEach((token) => {
    // Add random spaces before the token
    const spaceCount = Math.floor(Math.random() * (spaceRatio * gridSize));
    addSpacesToGrid(spaceCount);

    // Add the token itself
    addTokenToGrid(token);
  });

  // Push the last grid if it has content
  grids.push(currentGrid);

  // Convert each grid's rows into single 40-character strings
  const formattedGrids = grids.map((grid) => grid.map((row) => row.join('')));

  return formattedGrids;
}
```

---

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Row Concatenation**:
   - After all tokens are placed, each grid is processed using `map` to join each row into a single 40-character string.
   - This ensures that each row in the grid is represented as a single string.

2. **Return Format**:
   - The function now returns an array of grids, where each grid is an array of 40 strings (each string is 40 characters long).

---

### Example Usage

```javascript
const tokens = ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'test'];
const grids = buildGrid, 0.5);

console.log(grids);
/*
[
  [
    "     hello     world                        ",
    "          this     is                      ",
    "          a        test                    ",
    "                                          ",
    ...
  ],
  ...
]
*/
```

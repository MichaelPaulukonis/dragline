# Running ES module with JSON import in Node.js (2025-04-03 01:38Z)

_**User (2025-04-03 02:04Z)**_

How can I run this file? I'm using node.js 22.14.0, and attempting to execute the code results in the following error: import blocks from '../src/blocks.json' assert { type: 'json' }

This is not a finished project.

---

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because the `assert { type: 'json' }` syntax for importing JSON files is only supported in ES modules (ESM). By default, Node.js treats `.js` files as CommonJS modules unless explicitly configured to use ESM.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that Node.js treats your file as an ES module. Here are the steps:

### 1. Rename the file to `.mjs`
Rename `gridit.js` to `gridit.mjs`. Node.js automatically treats `.mjs` files as ES modules.

### 2. Use `"type": "module"` in `package.json`
Alternatively, you can add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json` file to tell Node.js to treat all `.js` files as ES modules:

```json
{
  "name": "p5js-vite",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build --emptyOutDir",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist --nojekyll",
    "publish": "npm run build && npm run deploy"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "gh-pages": "^6.3.0",
    "jest": "^29.7.0",
    "vite": "^6.2.3"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.7.7",
    "cheerio": "^1.0.0",
    "p5": "^1.11.1",
    "p5js-wrapper": "^1.2.3"
  }
}
```

### 3. Run the file
After applying one of the above changes, you can run the file using Node.js:

```bash
node aux/gridit.js
```

### Additional Notes
- If you are using `"type": "module"`, ensure all `require` statements in your project are replaced with `import` statements, as CommonJS `require` is not supported in ESM.
- If you encounter other issues, such as missing dependencies, ensure you have installed them using `npm install`.

_**User (2025-04-03 02:06Z)**_

Thanks! I've changed the filetype, but getting the following error: SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'assert'

---

_**Assistant**_

The error `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'assert'` indicates that Node.js is not recognizing the `assert { type: 'json' }` syntax. This feature is only supported in ES modules (ESM) starting from Node.js 20. If you're using Node.js 22.14.0, this should work, but there might be an issue with your environment setup.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

---

### 1. **Ensure Node.js is Running in ESM Mode**
   - Verify that your file is being treated as an ES module:
     - If you renamed the file to `.mjs`, Node.js should automatically treat it as an ES module.
     - If you're using `"type": "module"` in `package.json`, ensure the file is still named with a `.js` extension.

---

### 2. **Check Node.js Version**
   - Run the following command to confirm your Node.js version:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - Ensure it outputs `v22.14.0`. If not, you may need to update or switch to the correct version using a version manager like `nvm`:
     ```bash
     nvm install 22.14.0
     nvm use 22.14.0
     ```

---

### 3. **Use a Dynamic `import()` for JSON Files**
   If the issue persists, you can dynamically import the JSON file instead of using `assert { type: 'json' }`. Replace the `import` statement with the following:

   ```javascript
   const blocks = await import('../src/blocks.json', { assert: { type: 'json' } }).then(module => module.default);
   ```

   This approach works in ES modules and avoids the `assert` syntax issue.

---

### 4. **Fallback: Use `fs` to Read JSON**
   If the above solutions don't work, you can use the `fs` module to read the JSON file manually:

   ```javascript
   import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

   const blocks = JSON.parse(await readFile(new URL('../src/blocks.json', import.meta.url)));
   ```

---

### 5. **Verify Your Environment**
   - Ensure your project is running in a clean environment without conflicting configurations.
   - If you're using a custom Node.js runtime (e.g., via Docker or a specific IDE setup), ensure it supports the required features.

_**User (2025-04-03 02:09Z)**_

I used option #3 ("await import") but get the following error: node:internal/modules/esm/assert:88
        throw new ERR_IMPORT_ATTRIBUTE_MISSING(url, 'type', validType);
              ^

TypeError [ERR_IMPORT_ATTRIBUTE_MISSING]: Module "file:///Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/dragline/src/blocks.json" needs an import attribute of "type: json"

---

_**Assistant**_

The error indicates that Node.js still requires the `assert { type: 'json' }` attribute when importing JSON files. This is a strict requirement for JSON imports in ES modules. Since you are using the `await import` syntax, the `assert` attribute must be included.

Here’s how you can fix this issue:

---

### Correct Syntax for Dynamic Import with `assert { type: 'json'}`

Replace your current JSON import with the following:

```javascript
const blocks = await import('../src/blocks.json', { assert: { type: 'json' } });
```

This will dynamically import the JSON file with the required `assert` attribute. The `blocks` variable will then contain the JSON data.

---

### Ensure Your Environment Supports JSON Imports
1. **Node.js Version**: Verify that you are using Node.js 20 or later. Run:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
   If your version is older, update Node.js to the latest version.

2. **ES Module Configuration**:
   - Ensure your file is treated as an ES module:
     - Use the `.mjs` extension for your file.
     - Or, add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json`.

---

### Alternative: Use `fs` to Read JSON
If the above still doesn’t work, you can use the `fs` module to read the JSON file instead of using `import`. Replace the import with this:

```javascript
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

const blocks = JSON.parse(await readFile(new URL('../src/blocks.json', import.meta.url)));
```

This approach avoids the `assert` syntax entirely and works in all Node.js versions.

Sideways problem -  set the "runtimeExecutable" in your launch.json

---

_**Assistant**_

To set the `runtimeExecutable` in your `launch.json`, you can specify the path to the Node.js executable you want to use. This is useful if you have multiple versions of Node.js installed or are using a version manager like `nvm`.

Here’s how you can update your `launch.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "gridit tests",
      "skipFiles": [
        "<node_internals>/**"
      ],
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/aux/gridit.js",
      "runtimeExecutable": "/path/to/node" // Replace with the path to your Node.js executable
    }
  ]
}
```

### Steps to Find the Path to Node.js
1. Run the following command in your terminal to find the path to the Node.js executable:
   ```bash
   which node
   ```
   This will output something like `node` or `/Users/your-username/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin/node`.

2. Replace `/path/to/node` in the `runtimeExecutable` field with the path from the above command.

### Example
If the output of `which node` is `node`, your `launch.json` would look like this:

```jsonc
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "gridit tests",
      "skipFiles": [
        "<node_internals>/**"
      ],
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/aux/gridit.js",
      "runtimeExecutable": "/usr/local/bin/node"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Save and Run
After making this change, save the file and try running your script again using the debugger in VS Code. Let me know if you encounter further issues!

_**User (2025-04-03 02:16Z)**_

node appears to be in my PATH, and "which node" yeilds the expected version. I am using nvm to change version, so I wouldn't want to specifiy it in launch.json. What might cause VS Code to not find node on the PATH?

---

_**Assistant**_

If VS Code is unable to find `node` on your `PATH`, even though it works in your terminal, the issue is likely related to how VS Code inherits environment variables on macOS. By default, VS Code may not load the same shell environment as your terminal, especially if you're using a version manager like `nvm`.

Here are steps to resolve the issue:

---

### 1. **Ensure VS Code Loads Your Shell Environment**
On macOS, VS Code may not automatically load the environment variables from your shell configuration file (e.g., `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`). To fix this:

- Open VS Code settings (`Cmd + ,`).
- Search for `terminal.integrated.inheritEnv`.
- Ensure it is set to `true`.

Alternatively, you can add the following to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.inheritEnv": true
}
```

---

### 2. **Set the Correct Shell in VS Code**
Ensure VS Code is using the same shell as your terminal. To check or set this:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd + Shift + P`).
2. Search for and select **"Preferences: Open Default Profile"**.
3. Ensure the shell matches the one you use in your terminal (e.g., `zsh` for Zsh or `bash` for Bash).

---

### 3. **Fix `nvm` Integration**
If you're using `nvm`, it may not be initialized properly in VS Code. Add the following to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`):

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

Then restart your terminal and VS Code.

---

### 4. **Use `env` to Debug PATH in VS Code**
To confirm that `node` is available in the `PATH` used by VS Code:

1. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + `` or Cmd + ``).
2. Run:
   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   which node
   ```
3. Ensure the output includes the path to the `node` executable.

If `node` is not found, it means VS Code is not inheriting the correct environment variables.

---

### 5. **Workaround: Explicitly Set PATH in `launch.json`**
If the above steps don't work, you can explicitly set the `PATH` in your `launch.json` configuration:

```jsonc
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "gridit tests",
      "skipFiles": [
        "<node_internals>/**"
      ],
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/aux/gridit.js",
      "env": {
        "PATH": "/Users/your-username/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin:${env:PATH}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace `/Users/your-username/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin` with the output of `nvm which 22.14.0`.

---

### 6. **Restart VS Code**
After making any of the above changes, restart VS Code to ensure the new environment variables are loaded.

_**User (2025-04-03 02:26Z)**_

The shell environment is failing to resolve when vs code is launched from Spotlight. Some searches suggest nvm is a common problem. What are some ways we could speed up nvm?

---

_**Assistant**_

`nvm` can sometimes slow down shell initialization, especially in environments like VS Code where the shell is frequently spawned. Here are some ways to speed up `nvm`:

---

### 1. **Lazy Load `nvm`**
Instead of loading `nvm` every time a shell starts, you can defer its initialization until it's actually needed. Modify your `.zshrc` to include the following:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"

# Lazy load nvm
nvm() {
  unset -f nvm
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
  nvm "$@"
}
```

This will only load `nvm` when you run an `nvm` command or a command that depends on it.

---

### 2. **Use `nvm use` Only When Necessary**
If you frequently switch Node.js versions, you can avoid running `nvm use` automatically by disabling it in your `.zshrc`. Instead, manually run `nvm use` only when needed.

---

### 3. **Pin a Default Node.js Version**
Set a default Node.js version to avoid unnecessary lookups. Add this to your `.zshrc`:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
nvm alias default 22.14.0
```

This ensures that `nvm` always uses the specified version without additional checks.

---

### 4. **Use `fnm` as an Alternative**
[`fnm`](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) (Fast Node Manager) is a faster alternative to `nvm`. It is written in Rust and significantly reduces shell initialization time. To switch to `fnm`:

1. Install `fnm`:
   ```bash
   brew install fnm
   ```

2. Add the following to your `.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   eval "$(fnm env)"
   ```

3. Use `fnm` commands (similar to `nvm`) to manage Node.js versions.

---

### 5. **Optimize VS Code's Shell Integration**
If the issue is specific to VS Code, you can optimize how it interacts with your shell:

- Open VS Code settings (`Cmd + ,`).
- Search for `terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx`.
- Set it to `zsh` (or your preferred shell).

Additionally, ensure that `terminal.integrated.inheritEnv` is set to `true` in your VS Code settings.

---

### 6. **Preload Node.js Version in VS Code**
If you always use the same Node.js version in VS Code, you can preload it by adding the following to your `.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin:$PATH"
```

This bypasses `nvm` entirely for VS Code, as it directly adds the Node.js version to your `PATH`.

---

### 7. **Use `.nvmrc` Files Efficiently**
If your project uses an `.nvmrc` file, you can speed up `nvm` by ensuring it doesn't automatically search for the file. Instead, manually run:

```bash
nvm use
```

---

### 8. **Profile Shell Startup**
To identify bottlenecks in your `.zshrc`, you can profile your shell startup:

1. Run:
   ```bash
   zsh -xv
   ```
2. Look for slow commands and optimize them.

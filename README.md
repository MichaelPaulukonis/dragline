# dragline

An experimental text display using HTML canvas to bypass rendering differences in browsers.

TBH this "solves" a problem that has bothered me for over a decade - draggable, perfectly aligned (monospaced) text. Not really sure why I never considered the canvas until now.

It's not so much a tool as it is a piece of its own.

## TODO

- connect to tumblr for text for now
- save screen ?
  - without the background
  - click-drag for a defined area to use a canvas?
- auto-movement?
  - this may be a separate project
